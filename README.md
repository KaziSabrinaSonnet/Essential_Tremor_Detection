# Essential_Tremor_Detection
A diagnostic tool has been developed for essential tremor (ET), the world’s most common MD, through analysis of a tablet- or mobile-based drawing
task that replaces the need for pen-and-paper drawing tests while permitting advanced quantitative analysis of drawing smoothness, pressure applied, and other measures.
Data is securely recorded and stored in the cloud, from which all analysis is conducted remotely. Several features are extracted and recursive feature elimination applied 
to rank the features’ individual contribution to the classifier. Maximum cross-validated classification accuracy on a preliminary sample set is 98.3%. This highly promising new technology has the potential to
substantially alleviate the demands placed on both clinicians and patients by bringing MD treatment more into line with the era of personalized medicine.
